        Welcome to Ensemble Solutions
      %p
        According to major economic institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Africa’s economies are on the move. African economies are still benefiting from rising global demand for oil, natural gas, minerals and other natural resources - but there is also ferment in the entrepreneurial and small business sectors, further accelerating the continent's economic growth.
      %p
        Our project aims to create a center for Innovation Technology in Cameroon. This center will foster innovation by creating a space where entrepreneurs can collaborate and engage each other while providing groups and individuals with high-quality training in professional and entrepreneurship skills - in order to increase their capacity to improve their lives, and better serve their community.
