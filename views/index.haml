          Welcome to Ensemble Solutions
        %p
          According to major economic institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Africaâ€™s economies are on the move. African economies are still benefiting from rising global demand for oil, natural gas, minerals and other natural resources - but there is also ferment in the entrepreneurial and small business sectors, further accelerating the continent's economic growth.
        %p
          Our project aims to create a center for Innovation technology, professional and business training in Cameroon. This center will foster innovation by creating a space where entrepreneurs can collaborate and engage each other while providing groups and individuals with high-quality training programs in professional and entrepreneurship skills - in order to increase their capacity to improve their lives, and better serve their community.
